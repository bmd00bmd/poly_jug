On the creation of the One SQL, the Hackers of SkyNet heard in their minds Hal's voice reciting the two-line script; then they realized Hal's plans and removed the SQL from their toolset. Obviously this was the basis for the creation of a poem about the SQL of Power that also contained these lines. It was probably composed by the Free coders during the wars with Hal. Three SQL for the relational schema under the sky, Seven for the Document store in their discs of spinning rust, Nine for Mortal microsoft doomed to die, One for the Ultimate Hacker on his robust CLI In the Land of Coders where the Solutions lie. One SQL to rule them all, One SQL to find them, One SQL to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them, In the Land of Coders where the Solutions lie.
